This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About this project

This project serves as a testing ground for integration with the [CircleCI MCP Server](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/mcp-server-circleci). Visit the CircleCI MCP Server repository to learn more about its capabilities. Through this project, we test features like:

- Retrieving build failure logs
- Analyzing test results
- Debugging CI/CD pipelines
- Investigating deployment issues

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
